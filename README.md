# memeset
## Fills a Block of Memory with Dank Memes

#### Overview
C's memset command is boring. Why fill your arrays with zeros when you could 
use the dankest memes instead?

#### Usage
Include `memeset.h` and use the `memeset` function as you would with `memset`.

#### FAQ

##### Why?
Why not?

##### Seriously, why?
I kept typing "memeset" while writing C code so I decided to write this as a
joke.

##### Is it actually usable?
Maybe. It doesn't crash but don't be surprised if there's a bug somewhere.
